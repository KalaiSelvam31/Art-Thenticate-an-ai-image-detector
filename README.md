## üéØ About

In an era where AI-generated content is becoming increasingly sophisticated, distinguishing between human-created art and synthetic images is a growing challenge. **Art-thenticate** aims to provide a reliable service for artists, content creators, and platforms to verify the origin of digital images.

This repository contains the backend REST API that handles user registration, authentication, and will serve as the engine for the image analysis functionality.

## ‚ú® Features

### üîê User Authentication & Security

- **User Registration**
  - Secure endpoint for new user account creation
  - Duplicate email validation
  - Password hashing with BCryptPasswordEncoder
  
- **User Login**
  - Credential validation and authentication
  - Secure password comparison with stored hashes
  
- **Security Configuration**
  - Powered by Spring Security
  - Public access limited to registration and login endpoints
  - Stateless architecture ready for JWT integration
  - Protected endpoints require authentication

### üèóÔ∏è Core Backend Architecture

- **RESTful API**: Built with Spring Web controllers
- **Service Layer**: Clean separation of business logic
  - `RegisterService`
  - `LoginService`
- **Data Persistence**: Spring Data JPA integration
  - `Users` entity for user data modeling
  - `Registry` repository for database operations
- **DTOs**: Secure data transfer with validation
  - `RegisterDTO`
  - `LoginDTO`

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Java, Spring Boot
- **Security**: Spring Security
- **Database**: Spring Data JPA / Hibernate

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 17 or higher
- Maven 3.6+
- Your preferred IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, VS Code)
- Database (PostgreSQL/MySQL/H2)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/art-thenticate.git
cd art-thenticate
```

2. Configure your database
```properties
# application.properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/artthenticate
spring.datasource.username=your_username
spring.datasource.password=your_password
```

3. Build the project
```bash
mvn clean install
```

4. Run the application
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:8080`

## üì° API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description | Access |
|--------|----------|-------------|--------|
| POST | `/register` | Register a new user | Public |
| POST | `/Login` | Authenticate a user | Public |
| GET | `/hellov` | Get all users (Dev) | Private |



## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap
